# Intro

This is a small node.js postgresql tool used in my fathers personal website.

It uses docker, node.js and postgress. This is is more or less based on https://github.com/twright-msft/mssql-node-docker-demo-app.git

The main goal for me is to make a sort of framework to easily make some data exposed in a REST API.

# How to build and run:

    > docker-compose build
    > docker-compose up
